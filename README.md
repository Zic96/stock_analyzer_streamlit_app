## About Stock Analyzer App
Analyzing a stock is a hard and sometimes confusing process. Everyone has
his way. The financial ratios are infinity. With this app, you can type any symbol of a USA stock
and in a few moments, you will have access to some critical fundamental metrics (profitability, margins, financial health, etc). Furthermore, you will get a dividend analysis,
what funds invest in these companies, What analysts think, and some technical analysis graphs.
This app uses the yfinance library so I do my best to get as much information as possible, however, if you use any API you could
create a more complex analyzer tool. The reason I use yfinance is that I want to showcase some of the possibilities you can create even
with 'free' data! This tool is by far not perfect but I hope it can help you! 

**Disclaimer:** This tool should NOT be used for financial desition, I am not a financial advisor! This is for educational proposes and only! Some times data 
had delays and mistakes!
